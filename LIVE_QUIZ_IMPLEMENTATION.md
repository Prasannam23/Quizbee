# Live Quiz System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a comprehensive real-time quiz system with separate teacher and student interfaces, featuring live participation tracking, leaderboards, and WebSocket-based communication.

## Architecture

### 1. Zustand Stores

#### `useAuthStore.ts`
- Manages user authentication state
- Handles login/logout/signup
- Stores user role (TEACHER/STUDENT)
- Manages loading and error states

#### `useQuizStore.ts`
- Manages quiz data and state
- Actions: `getQuizzes`, `getQuizById`, `createQuiz`, `cacheQuizToRedis`, `updateQuizState`
- Handles quiz listing, details, and state transitions

#### `useWebSocketStore.ts`
- Manages WebSocket connection and real-time state
- Handles reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Manages room joining, quiz state, participants, leaderboard
- Actions: `connect`, `joinRoom`, `startQuiz`, `nextQuestion`, `endQuiz`, `submitAnswer`

### 2. Key Components

#### WebSocket Components
- **`WebSocketProvider.tsx`**: Manages WebSocket lifecycle and automatic reconnection
- **`CreateRoomButton.tsx`**: Teacher component to cache quiz and create live room
- **`LiveParticipants.tsx`**: Shows real-time participant list
- **`LiveLeaderboard.tsx`**: Shows real-time leaderboard with score updates

#### Quiz Interfaces
- **`StudentQuizInterface.tsx`**: Complete student quiz experience
  - Waiting state, question display, answer submission
  - Timer with color coding
  - Answer feedback and score tracking
  - Mobile-responsive leaderboard positioning
  
- **`TeacherQuizControl.tsx`**: Complete teacher control panel
  - Quiz management and monitoring
  - Live participant tracking
  - Question progression controls
  - Real-time statistics

### 3. Page Routing

#### `/dashboard/[quizId]`
- Role-based rendering:
  - Teachers: Quiz details with room creation
  - Students: Quiz preview
  - Live quiz: Redirects to appropriate interface

#### `/test/[quizId]`
- Student-only access
- Direct entry for quiz participation
- Handles quiz state validation

### 4. Real-time Features

#### WebSocket Messages
```typescript
- JOIN_ROOM: User joins quiz room
- START_QUIZ: Teacher starts quiz
- QUESTION_CHANGE: New question broadcast
- ANSWER: Student submits answer
- LEADERBOARD_UPDATE: Score updates
- QUIZ_END: Quiz completion
```

#### Live Updates
- Participant join/leave notifications
- Real-time leaderboard updates
- Question progression tracking
- Answer feedback and scoring

### 5. UI/UX Features

#### Responsive Design
- Mobile leaderboard: bottom positioning
- Desktop leaderboard: side panel
- Adaptive question display
- Touch-friendly answer selection

#### Visual Feedback
- Timer color coding (green > yellow > red)
- Answer validation with color feedback
- Loading states and transitions
- Toast notifications for actions

### 6. Quiz Flow

#### Teacher Flow
1. Create quiz or select existing
2. Click "Create Room" to cache quiz
3. WebSocket connection established
4. Students join room automatically
5. Start quiz when ready
6. Monitor live participation
7. Progress through questions
8. View final results

#### Student Flow
1. Access quiz via join code or direct link
2. Automatic WebSocket connection
3. Wait for teacher to start
4. Answer questions with timer
5. Receive immediate feedback
6. View live leaderboard
7. See final results

### 7. State Management

#### Quiz States
- `yet_to_start`: Initial state, room creation available
- `waiting`: Room created, waiting for start
- `starting`: Quiz initiation in progress
- `in_progress`: Active quiz with questions
- `ended`: Quiz completed, results available

#### Connection Management
- Automatic reconnection with backoff
- Connection state tracking
- Error handling and recovery
- Token-based authentication

### 8. Security & Validation

#### Access Control
- Role-based component rendering
- Teacher-only quiz controls
- Student-only quiz participation
- JWT token validation

#### Input Validation
- Quiz state checks before actions
- Connection state validation
- Answer submission validation
- Timer-based auto-submission
